## Asking for support
If you need help, here are a few tips:

1. Be polite: You'd be shocked how many people demand everything for nothing.
2. Keep other people's time in mind: **The most time consuming part of fixing a bug is replicating it.** Half-assed bug reports, will get half-assed responses (or even just simply closed if you ignored submitting the detail we clearly ask for). The more detail you can share, the better. 

Here is how you can make this process much easier for everyone:

### 1. Tell us what version you are running
You can find your version by running [Amplitude.getVersion()](https://serversdieup.net/open-source/amplitudejs/docs/functions/#get-version) in your browser console.

### 2. Submit a public URL where the bug is happening
Give us a link where you are experiencing the issue. It's really hard to help you if we can't see what you are looking at ðŸ˜€

### 3. Tell us what device you are having issues with
You can easily do this by visiting [https://www.whatsmybrowser.org/](https://www.whatsmybrowser.org/) from the device that you are having issues with. Once there, it will generate a "support URL" for you. We just need that URL and it will give us everything we need to know about your device to help you.
