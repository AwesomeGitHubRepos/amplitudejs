# Installation

## Option 1: Use CDN from [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/amplitudejs/)
No installation is required to use Amplitude.js. All you need to do is include a single line in your `<head>` section of your HTML page.

Replace `{{'version-number'}}` with the exact version number that you would like to use (see [our releases](https://github.com/serversideup/amplitudejs/releases) for what version number to use):

::code-panel
---
label: Include AmplitudeJS in the header of your file
---
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/amplitudejs@{{version-number}}/dist/amplitude.js"></script>
```
::

**NOTE:** It's best to set your version number manually to make sure you have full control of what version you are running. If you need to upgrade in the future, just change `{{'version-number'}}` to the latest version.

## Option 2: Automatic install via `npm`

Download it via NPM to your existing project:

::code-panel
---
label: Install AmplitudeJS with NPM
---
```sh
npm install --save amplitudejs
```
::

You will see the file under `node_modules/amplitudejs/dist/amplitude.js`.

## Option 3: Manual download

Download the `amplitude.js` file from [our releases page](https://github.com/serversideup/amplitudejs/releases) and include the file manually with your project.

Amplitude.js is now available for use! All that's left is [initializing &rarr;](https://serversideup.net/open-source/amplitudejs/docs/installation/initialization).
