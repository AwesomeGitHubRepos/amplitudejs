# Setting the Starting Audio and Starting Playlist

When you initialize AmplitudeJS you can instruct AmplitudeJS to start at a certain song, certain playlist, and a certain song in a playlist.

## Set Starting Song

To set a starting song, you simply need to add the `start_song` key and pass it the index of the song you want to start. By default this is 0, the first song in the array. To set it to the fourth song in the array, index 3, do this:

::code-panel
---
label: Set the start song
---
```javascript
Amplitude.init({
    songs: ["..."],
    start_song: 3
});
```
::

## Set Starting Playlist

You can also define which playlist to start with if you have multiple playlists. Similar to the `start_song` you need to pass the `starting_playlist` key to the `init` method:

::code-panel
---
label: Define the starting playlist
---
```javascript
Amplitude.init({
    songs: ["..."],
    playlists: {
        "key_of_starting_playlist": ["..."]
    },
    starting_playlist: "key_of_starting_playlist"
});
```
::

## Set Starting Song In Playlist

Finally, you can set which song you want to start the player with inside which playlist. To do this, you need to define the `starting_playlist` key and the `starting_playlist_song` index like this:

::code-panel
---
label: Set the starting playlist and starting song
---
```javascript
Amplitude.init({
    songs: ["..."],
    playlists: {
        "key_of_starting_playlist": ["..."]
    },
    starting_playlist: "key_of_starting_playlist",
    starting_playlist_song: 3
});
```
