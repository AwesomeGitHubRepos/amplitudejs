# Delay Between Audio

AmplitudeJS allows the developer to add a time delay between the audio objects defined. By default, this value is `0`. When you initialize AmplitudeJS you can provide an integer in MS for how long you want AmplitudeJS to wait before it starts playing the next audio track.

## Initialization

You can set this value on initialization:

::code-panel
---
label: Set a delay between songs
---
```javascript
Amplitude.init({
    songs: ["..."],
    delay: 3000
});
```
::

AmplitudeJS will now wait 3 seconds before playing the next track.

## Public Function
You can also set this value through a public function like this:

::code-panel
---
label: Set song delay with public method
---
```javascript
Amplitude.setDelay( 3000 );
```
::

If you need to see what the delay is set to, run:

::code-panel
---
label: Get the current delay
---
```javascript
Amplitude.getDelay();
```
::
