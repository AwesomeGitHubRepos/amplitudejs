# Defaulting Shuffle On

You can turn shuffle on right away when initializing AmplitudeJS. To do that, simply initialize AmplitudeJS with the `shuffle_on` parameter like this:

::code-panel
---
label: Turn shuffle on for songs
---
```javascript
Amplitude.init({
    songs: ["..."],
    shuffle_on: true
});
```
::

By default, AmplitudeJS will shuffle the songs and start with the first song in the shuffled list.
